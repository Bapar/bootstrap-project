				<center><h1>PC Building Tutorial</h1></center>
				<p>There are many different ways to build a computer, different people will tell you different things. I've built a few computers and learned many different tricks and right or wrong ways to do things. This tutorial consists of what I think the best way to put a PC together is.</p><br>
				<center><h2>Choosing the Right Hardware</h2></center>
				<p>There are a lot of things to choose from when it comes to computer hardware. It can be overwelming to pick out parts for your PC if you don't know what your looking for.</p>
				<p>The best place to purchase computer parts is on the Internet. Not only is this the cheapest route to go, but you have a much bigger selection, and usually much more information about that piece of hardware. The websites that I recomend are <a href = "http://www.newegg.com">Newegg</a>, <a href = "http://www.tigerdirect.com">Tiger Direct</a>, and <a href = "http://www.amazon.com">Amazon</a>.</p>
				<p>When picking out hardware, you need to think about what you're going to use your computer for. If your just going to browse the web, and do basic word-processing, you can get away with some of the cheapest parts, and still have a great experience. If you're going to use your computer for gaming, or editing photos, or videos, then you'll likely need some of the higher end parts. To find out which parts are right for you, take a look at these pages: <a href = "motherboard.html">Motherboards</a>, <a href = "ram.html">RAM</a>, <a href = "cpu.html">CPU</a>, <a href = "gpu.html">GPU</a>, <a href = "storage.html">Storage</a>, and <a href = "case.html">Case</a>.</p>
				<center><h2>Tools That You'll Need</h2></center>
				<ul>
					<li>You'll need some type of thermal paste which is used to transfer heat from the CPU to its heatsink.I reccomend Arctic Silver, which can be found <a href = "http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16835100007&cm_re=artic_silver-_-35-100-007-_-Product">here</a>. Or you can just use the low quality thermal compund that is usually already on your stock heatsink, but the performance of your CPU won't be quite as good if you do this.</li>
					<li>You'll want some rubbing alchohol and cotton balls if your going to use your own thermal compound. These can be used to get rid of the low quality thermal compound already on the stock heatsink</li>
					<li>You'll also need at least one screw driver, I only use one since most of the screws will be about the same size.</li>
					<li>I recommend getting some plastic tie raps to organize the cables inside your case. This will improve air flow, and if you have a window on your case it'll look nicer.</li>
				</ul>
				<center><h2>Putting the Pieces Together</h2></center>
				<p>After you've picked your hardware, it's all been shipped to you, and you have your tools ready, you're ready to build your computer. It's best to build your computer outside of the case first. What I usually do, is unrap the motherboard, and put it on top of its box. After you've done that, take these steps in order:<br>
				<ol>
					<li>The first thing to put on the motherboard is the CPU. If you're using your own thermal paste, then remove the stuff from the bottom of the stock heatsink using rubbing alchohol and cotton balls.</li>
					<li>Next, you need to put the CPU heatsink bracket onto the back of the motherboard. Some CPU's just snap into the holes on the mothboard, if that's the case then skip this step. Be sure to put the screws in opposite of the previous one that you put in, like for example, top left, then bottom right, then top right, then bottom left. Be sure not to tighten the screws until they're all in.</li>
					<li>Next, you'll need to remove the cover from the CPU bay on the motherboard, this is usually a sqare piece of plastic with a metal bracket covering it.</li>
					<li>Next, you need to put the cpu into the port by dropping it from just above the holes for the pins. Do this as evenly as possible to avoid bending any pins.</li>
					<li>Next, you apply the the thermal past, unless you're using the stuff that's already on the stock heatsink. I usually apply a pea sized blob in the middle of the cpu, and spread it around with my finger, but there are many other ways of doing this as well.</li>
					<li>Next, you put the heatsink on top of the CPU with as even of pressure as possible. Then put the screws, or tabs if you didn't have a bracket, in the same way that you did for the bracket on the back of the motherboard. Assuming that you had a bracket.Then you can plug the heatsink int the motherboard</li>
					<li>Next, you can put the RAM into their slots. Align the tabs on the RAM sticks with the tabs on the ports on the motherboard, and just push them in until you hear a snap.</li>
					<li>Next, you can put the GPU in, if you're using one. This will go into a pci express port on the motherboard, which is the long port, sometimes there are more than one of these on the motherboard. Just push the card into the slot until you hear a clicking noise.</li>
					<li>Next, you can plug your hard drive or ssd into the motherboard using a sata cable which should come with your motherboard.</li>
					<li>Now your ready to plug everything in. get you power supply, if it came with your case there's no need to take it out. Then, using the manual that came with your motherboard, identify each spot that needs something plugged into it. Usually this will be the motherboard power which is the biggest, then the CPU power next to the CPU, then the GPU power which is on the GPU itself, then the storage power which is on the drive itself.</li>
					<li>Now you're ready to test out the computer. After you plug a monitor, and keyboard into the computer, plug the power supply into the wall. You need to short the power button on the motherboard to turn it on. Your motherboards manual will tell you were the power button prongs are. Simply touch a screwdriver to the prongs on the motherboard, and the computer should start.</li>
					<li>You should see the post screen for the computer and then either a BIOS or UEFI, depending on you motherboard. The BIOS or UEFI is the  software on the motherboard that you can use to set up the computer initially. Using the motherboards manual to direct you through the BIOS, find out how much RAM the BIOS found, and wether or not it can see your storage drive(s). If you hardware is listed in the bios, then you did it right.</li>
					<li>If your power supply isn't already in your case, screw it into its port.</li>
					<li>Now it's time to transfer the computer to the case. Turn off the computer, unplug everything, and find your motherboard standoffs. These standoffs should come with your motherboard, they look like screws with a big head. Screw the standoffs into the case wherever there's a hole in your motherboard.</li>
					<li>Next, carefully put the motherboard onto the standoffs, and start screwing it onto the case.Carefull not to overtighten the screws, and be sure keep them very loose until all screws are in, then tighten them.</li>
					<li>Then, put your storage device and your cd/flopy drive(s) into there proper bays in your case, and screw them in as well.</li>
					<li>Now plug the power supply back into the motherboard, GPU, storage device, and cd/floppy drive if you have one.</li>
					<li>Then organize the cables to maximize air flow, and put the cover on your case.</li>
					<li>Next, plug your monitor, keyboard, speakers, mouse, and any other peripheries that you're using, into the back of your computer.</li>
					<li>Now you can plug the computer and its peripheries into the wall, and you're done. turn on your computer and enjoy.</li>
