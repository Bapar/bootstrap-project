				<center><h2>Do You Really Need a GPU?</h2></center>
				<center><p>Nowadays GPUs are an optional part to put into your coputer. Usually your CPU will have a GPU integrated on the chip. Integrated GPU's are great because they're cheap, you just have to buy a CPU, and they're super compact compared to all grapics cards.So if you don't care about playing the latest 3d games, and you don't edit videos and photos, then just stick with the integrated grapics to save mooney, and space.</p></center>
				<center><h2>Picking Your GPU</h2></center>
				<center><p>If you've decided that you want a discrete graphics card rather than integrated, you'll notice that ther're a lot of graphics cards to choose from. There are only two compainies competing with eachother right now, those are Nvidia and AMD. Many people will tell you that one is better than the other, but it seems to me that AMD makes cards that are cheaper for the performance that you get than Nvidia. Nvidia however, tends to run cooler and quieter than AMD cards. Personally I've owned two AMD cards which were actually ATI cards at the time (AMD bought out ATI), and both of them overheated and died. I've had much better luck with Nvidia cards, so I always buy Nvidia. There are many reasons to buy one or the other though, so just look around and see which brand seems good to you, or which one's on sale.</p></center>
				<center><p>When picking a GPU, there tends to be a price point that gives you the best bang for your buck. That's usually around $150, but depending on how much you expect your GPU to do, you can get one that cheaper, or more expensive.</p></center>
