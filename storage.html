				<center><h1>Choosing Your Storage Type</h1></center>
				<center><p>There are two types of storage drives to choose from, either a solid state drive (SSD), or a hard disk drive (HDD). Both types of storage have their own pros and cons, but when in my opinion, having a small SSD and a big hard drive at the same time is the most const affective. This makes it so that you can install windows on the SSD, and get super-fast booting times and loading times for basic things like web browsers and word proccessors. Then you can use the hard drive to install bigger files like games, and to put your photos videos and music on.</p>

				<tr>
					<th>Hard Disk Drive</th>
					<td>Slow</td> 
					<td>About 9 cents</td>
					<td>Good</td>
					<td>Up to about 8TB</td>

				<tr>
					<th>Solid State Drive</th>
					<td>Super fast</td> 
					<td>About 38 cents</td>
					<td>Good</td>
					<td>About 1TB before major price increase.</td>

				<p>SSDs are super-fast. You'll notice a huge difference in your computers speed if you install your operating system and basic programs on an SSD. Your computer can boot up in 25% or less of the time that it would take with a hard drive. Sadly though, SSDs are expensive compared to hard drives, so it's usually best to have a small SSD combined with a big hard drive.</p>

				<p>Hard drives have been around much longer then SSDs. Hard drives are quite a bit slower than SSDs, but that doesn't meen that you should ignore them. Hard drives cost much less than SSDs for the amount of storage that you get. When you're playing music or videos off a hard drive, you won't notice much of a difference other then the speed that the video or music loads, but it's only a tiny difference in most cases. Hard drives are great to have just to store you're music and videos without having to spend a lot of money on multiple SSDs to hold that stuff.</p>
